# Hello! 
I'm *Harivelo Sem Elroya BEZAKA*, a student in Computer science and telecommunication engineering to the *university of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Italy*. I come from Madagascar, and i moved to Italy for study in 2014. It was a big challenge in my life leaving my country and starting a campus life , I learned new cultures, new languages, and meet a lot of  new people from other countries like Ireland, Burkina Faso,  Ethiopia,... I encountered many difficulties too in my adventure. I understood how big was the gap between education system in Europe and my country so i had to fill my lack in many topics like mathematic and physics. Till today i have conscience that i have many thing to review and learn, and i'm trying everyday to increase my own knowledges. That's why i create this website, it's my first one. 
I meet a very good friend, with whom i'm very thankful: *Nantenaina Andrianaivo Louis*, he was the one who teach me how to create this website. 
So here i want to share, some stories, experiences and informations about studying abroad, maybe that will help other people who will soon do the same.
